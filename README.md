# Calculate-Strain-Rate-Sensitivity
Calculate SRS of a slip system at given set of parameters using the consititutive law developed by Dunne et al: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijplas.2006.10.013.

Need to input the key parameters in the consitutive law (Activation Energy, Activation Volume, Critical resolved shear stress) as function of temperature.
